Format of the messages created by the dtmf-rcq application:



The dtmf-rcq application outputs text using the CSV (Comma Seperated
Value) format. It does this for the following events 

* B: BEGIN message
Format: B;<stream-id>;<timestamp-sec>;<timestamp-usec>;<module>;<mycall>;
<mycall-extension>;<yourcall>;<repeatercall1>;<repeatercall2>;<flags>

Notes:
- The stream-id is a 32-bit hexvalue that identifies a DV-stream.
It is used to link all information about a DV-stream together.

- the "timestamp" consists out of 2 values:
timestamp-sec: unix timestamp: number of seconds since unix "epoch" 
1/jan/1970 00:00:00 UTC
timestamp-usec: microseconds

- module: contains 1 for module B, 2 for module C and 3 for module A


* E: END message:
Format: E;<stream-id>;<timestamp-sec>;<timestamp-usec>;<frame-seqnr>;
<number-of-silent-frames>;<number-of-biterrors>;<number-of-missing-frames>

Note:
The number-of-silent-frames, number-of-biterrors, and number-or-missing-frames
give information about the statistics of the TOTAL stream.


* X: EXIT message:
Format: X;<stream-id>;<timestamp-sec>;<timestamp-usec>;<frame-seqnr>;
<number-of-silent-frames>;<number-of-biterrors>;<number-of-missing-frames>

Note:
An "EXIT" message is generated when a new "START" frames is received from
a particular module, without a previous "END"-frame.
This can happen if a "END" frame of a stream is lost.


* T: TRACK message:
Format T;<stream-id>;<timestamp-sec>;<timestamp-usec>;<frame-seqnr>;
<number-of-silent-frames>;<number-of-biterrors>;<number-of-missing-frames>

Note:
This is an message generated if the "tracking" option is enabled.
In contrast to the "END" and "EXIT" messages, these lines contain
statistics about the last TRACKING-interval, NOT about the TOTAL
stream.



* M: MESSAGE/TEXT message
Format: M;<stream-id>;<frame-seqnr>;<MESSAGE TEXT>;

Note:
The Message-text field contains the 20-octet text-message that can be
send in the "slow-speed data" part of a DV-frame.

dtmf-rcq will create a M-message line the first time a text-message
is received, or when a different message then before is received.

According the (unofficial) specification on the usage of text-message
information, this text-message should not change during the transmission
of a DV-stream, so maximum one single M-message should be produced
during a DV-stream.

However, as the slow-speed data part of a DV-stream does not contain any
error-correction or error-detection mechanism, it IS possible that the
dtfm-rcq application receives a message different then what received
before due to errors in the received DV-stream. Hence, it is possible
that multiple M-lines show up for one single DV-stream.



* D: DTMF messages
Format: D;<stream-id>;<DTMF-CODE>;<frame-seqnr>;<bit-errors>;


A DTMF message is generated in the following cases:
1/ for the FIRST DV-frame that is received containing a DTMF-code
- In that case, the <DTMF-CODE> field contains the value of the
received DTMF-code: 0 to 9 or A to D
- The <frame-seqne> field contains the sequence-number of this
particular frame in the DV-stream
- The <bit-errors> field contains the number of bit-errors found
in the DV-frame containing this particular frame.

2/ For the first concequative DV-frame that is received that does
NOT contain a DMTF-CODE ANYMORE.
In that case, the <DTMF-CODE> field contains the value "X"
The <frame-seqnr> field will contain the sequence-number of
the first frame NOT containing the DTMF-code anymore.


3/ For the first concequative DV-frame that contains a DIFFERENT
DMTF-CODE then found in preceding frames.
In that case, two lines are created:
- one line with the <DTMF-CODE> field containing the value "X"
- one line with the <DTMF-CODE> field containing the new DTMF-code
The <frame-seqnr> field will contain the same value in both
lines.

4/ For the first concequative DV-frame containing a DTMF-code, and
has LESS ERRORS then was the case in the previous frames of the
DV-frame.

This information is provided for two reasons:
- to be able to detect key-bounce. (the DTMF-code being pressed for
a short periode or changing very rapidly)
- to be able to detect errors. (the DTMF-decoding code has the tendency
to decode the DMTF-information incorrectly if the DV-frames contains to
many errors).



* W: WARNING messages
Format: W;<WARNING-type>;<streamid>;<timestamp-sec>;<timestamp-usec>;<module>;

Note:
Warning-type can be:
-BMIS: Begin missing: frame of ongoing DVstream received without
preceding configuration-frame.
-BCRC: CRC-error in configuration frame of DV.
