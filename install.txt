Installation procedure for DSTAR DTMF-RCQ software package



* 1/ Install the necessairy software:

(the following actions need to be done as root)

1a: "libpcap-devel" (header-files used to pcap-library)

yum install libpcap-devel

1b: the dtmf-rcq software:
- locate the source-code on http://villazeebries.krbonne.net/hamstuff/

- download the latest source-file:
(in this case, version 0.1.0)
-> wget http://villazeebries.krbonne.net/dstar/dtmf-rcq/dtmf-rcq-0.1.0.tar.gz

- unzip and extract
-> tar zxvf dtmf-rcq-0.1.0.tar.gz

- compile and install
-> cd dtmf-rcq-0.1.0
-> make
-> make install



* 2/ Makeing it secure.

The dtmf-rcq system has been specifically designed so it does
NOT have to run as root to operate.

As the software-package needs to be able to intercept and process
UDP-packages send between the gateway-server and the repeater-controller,
it does need root-priviledges for that part of its job.

For that reason, the dtmf-rcq packages has been designed in a layered
approach:
- Everything releated to capturing and low-level processing of the
UDP-traffic exchanged between then the repeater-controller and the
gateway-server is located inside one application: dtmf-rcq
This application needs root-priviledges and will -therefor- be run
with the help of "sudo"

- Processing of the received DTMF-codes is done in the perl-script
dtmf-distributor.pl. This application should NOT be run as root.

- all other scripts started by dtmf-distributor.pl should also
NOT be run as root.


It is very much adviced to create a seperate (non-root) user, to
insure the security of the repeater-system.

For this example, a user called "dmtf" is created:

- create a user for voice-announcement:
-> adduser dtmf

- set a password:
-> passwd dtmf

- enable sudo-access to /usr/bin/dtmf-rcq for the user "dtmf"
SUDO_EDITOR=nano sudoedit -e /etc/sudoers

Go to the bottom of the file and add this line:
dtmf ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dtmf-rcq



- copy the demo-application
-> cd demo
-> cp -Rb * /home/dtmf
-> chown -R dtmf:dtmf /home/dtmf/*


* 4/ testing it:

- log in as "dtmf" user

- start dtmf-rcq manually
sudo /usr/bin/dtmf-rcq -t 50 -i eth1 "src host 172.16.0.1 and udp port 20000"

If a D-STAR transmission is received by the repeater, the following
information should appear:
- one "B" (BEGIN) line at the beginning of the transmission
- a "M" (MESSAGE) line containing the text-message field of the transmitting
station
- a "T" (TRACKING) line every second containing intermediate radio-quality
transmission
- one "E"(END) line at the end of the transmission

Optionally, "D" lines should show up if the transmission contains
DMTF-codes.


- start "dtmd-dispatcher" (only for systems using the Dplus software)
./dtmf-dispatcher.pl

Sending the DTMF-codes "111" will play-out a voice-announcement with the
statistics of the last stream
This can also be achieved by making a D-STAR call to "        Q".

Sending the DTMF-codes "*001C" or "*0013" will link the repeater to
reflector REF001C

Sending the DTMF-codes "**" will unlink the repeater.

Sending any other code will result a broadcast-message containg the
text "Unknown DTMF" and the received DTMF-codes.


* Read and learn:

See the files "format.txt" and "programming.txt" for more info on
how to extend the dtmf-dispatcher program with your own programs.


Have fun!
